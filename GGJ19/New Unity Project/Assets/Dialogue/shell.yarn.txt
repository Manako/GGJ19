The very first gift they brought you back. "Put it to your ear, and listen for the ocean," they said. "If you listen close enough, you will always be able to hear us cheering you on." You put the shell to you ear, remembering all the times they guided you back home when you were little. You remember the way they laughed and sang, they way they would point to all the things that would help you home. You remember that you wanted to be just like them.
