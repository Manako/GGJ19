The soft sound of the knife against the cutting board, the sizzling delights, a sweet treat packed for an afternoon snack, you smile as the blue birds greet you at your windowsill. It is a beautiful morning, and the world awaits you. You look over to a framed picture on the table. Laughing faces greet you with blue skies stretching behind them. Yes. You too are ready to take that same step; you are ready to become an adventurer!
