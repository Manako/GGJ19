Soft fabric rubs against your cheeks, as the blanket is pulled up to your chin. You stand in the doorway, stone lined pathway leading into the bright forest beyond your little gate. They stand, bags packed, stuffed with pots, pans, blankets and joy. In their hands, tall and smooth, the knotted wood walking sticks stand proud and ready for another adventure. They smile at you, pat your head, pull your blanket tighter over your shoulders, before they hug you close.
