A mountain village, cradled by snow peaked hills was like a tale only dreams would spin. It was a gift they brought back from one of their travels. To see the world like them, that is what you wanted. Leaving behind little gestures of care like this always made you feel warm. They were thinking of you always, and when you were old enough, you would be able to join them. You would be able to see all the amazing sights of the world just as they had. And when they got to be too old, you would travel to places they had never been and give them pieces of your memories from there.
